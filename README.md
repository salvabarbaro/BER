Replication Data to the Paper entitled "Laboratory Experiments vs. Opportunistic Behavior: State Governments Strategies in Times of Pandemic."

## Description

This repository contains R and Stata files for replication purposes. Data sets are also embedded in this repository.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The codes were all tested on a debian linux. The stata file also works well on a windows OS. However, the bootstrap replication file uses parallel computing. Be aware of the hardware requirements. Please refer to the comments in the bootstrap script for more details. 

### Installing

Stand alone script. The library requirements can be seen at the scripts' headings.

### Executing program

* Line-by-line in an Editor (like RStudio) as well as as entire scripts (R < *.R)

## Help

Any advise for common problems or issues:
None. Please get in touch with the maintainer in case of issues with the scripts.
